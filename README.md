### "Notes"

The application could not run very smooth due to the features of the API used for this development.

The Api is a free API that might have some delay on loading, loading only one of the three areas to explore such as: Hotels, Attraction, and restaurans or it might not even load any of this data due to the 500 limit request per month.

Also, s first version of the application it is not fully responsive to the different devices in the market.
